# SquareWave-and-Filter
Generating Sine wave by using Square wave and Filter method
This project was made while me and my colleagues were at first year in univirsity, it was originally made using multisim but Unfortunatly i cant find the source from back then.
I will link the pdf we made back then which contain screenshots of design using multisim and result of this ocillator.
I recently was able to recreate the project using proteus this time and you can find the source with results .
